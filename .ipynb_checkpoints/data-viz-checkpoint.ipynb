Defaults to\n            \"none\" unless this trace is stacked, then it gets\n            \"tonexty\" (\"tonextx\") if `orientation` is \"v\" (\"h\") Use\n            with `fillcolor` if not \"none\". \"tozerox\" and \"tozeroy\"\n            fill to x=0 and y=0 respectively. \"tonextx\" and\n            \"tonexty\" fill between the endpoints of this trace and\n            the endpoints of the trace before it, connecting those\n            endpoints with straight lines (to make a stacked area\n            graph); if there is no trace before it, they behave\n            like \"tozerox\" and \"tozeroy\". \"toself\" connects the\n            endpoints of the trace (or each segment of the trace if\n            it has gaps) into a closed shape. \"tonext\" fills the\n            space between two traces if one completely encloses the\n            other (eg consecutive contour lines), and behaves like\n            \"toself\" if there is no trace before it. \"tonext\"\n            should not be used if one trace does not enclose the\n            other.

Defaults to a half-transparent\n            variant of the line color, marker color, or marker line\n            color, whichever is available.\n        fillpattern\n            Sets the pattern within the marker.\n        groupnorm\n            Only relevant when `stackgroup` is used, and only the\n            first `groupnorm` found in the `stackgroup` will be\n            used - including if `visible` is \"legendonly\" but not\n            if it is `false`. Sets the normalization for the sum of\n            this `stackgroup`. With \"fraction\", the value of each\n            trace at each location is divided by the sum of all\n            trace values at that location. \"percent\" is the same\n            but multiplied by 100 to show percentages. If there are\n            multiple subplots, or multiple `stackgroup`s on one\n            subplot, each will be normalized within its own set.\n        hoverinfo\n            Determines which trace information appear on hover. If\n            `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed\n            upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover\n            events are still fired.\n        hoverinfosrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `hoverinfo`.\n        hoverlabel\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.Hoverlabel`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        hoveron\n            Do the hover effects highlight individual points\n            (markers or line points) or do they highlight filled\n            regions?

When showing info for several\n            points, \"xother\" will be added to those with different\n            x positions from the first point. An underscore before\n            or after \"(x|y)other\" will add a space on that side,\n            only when this field is shown.

The variables available in\n            `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as event data\n            described at this link\n            https://plotly.com/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-\n            data. Additionally, every attributes that can be\n            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)\n            are available.  Anything contained in tag `<extra>` is\n            displayed in the secondary box, for example\n            \"<extra>{fullData.name}</extra>\". To hide the secondary\n            box completely, use an empty tag `<extra></extra>`.\n        hovertemplatesrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `hovertemplate`.\n        hovertext\n            Sets hover text elements associated with each (x,y)\n            pair. If a single string, the same string appears over\n            all the data points. If an array of string, the items\n            are mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y)\n            coordinates. To be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain\n            a \"text\" flag.\n        hovertextsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `hovertext`.\n        ids\n            Assigns id labels to each datum.

Items and groups\n            with smaller ranks are presented on top/left side while\n            with `*reversed* `legend.traceorder` they are on\n            bottom/right side. The default legendrank is 1000, so\n            that you can use ranks less than 1000 to place certain\n            items before all unranked items, and ranks greater than\n            1000 to go after all unranked items.\n        line\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.Line` instance or\n            dict with compatible properties\n        marker\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.Marker` instance\n            or dict with compatible properties\n        meta\n            Assigns extra meta information associated with this\n            trace that can be used in various text attributes.\n            Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and\n            colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`\n            `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`\n            text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`\n            values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use\n            `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the\n            `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in\n            layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`\n            is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace\n            index.\n        metasrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `meta`.\n        mode\n            Determines the drawing mode for this scatter trace. If\n            the provided `mode` includes \"text\" then the `text`\n            elements appear at the coordinates. Otherwise, the\n            `text` elements appear on hover. If there are less than\n            20 points and the trace is not stacked then the default\n            is \"lines+markers\". Otherwise, \"lines\".\n        name\n            Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the\n            legend item and on hover.\n        opacity\n            Sets the opacity of the trace.\n        orientation\n            Only relevant when `stackgroup` is used, and only the\n            first `orientation` found in the `stackgroup` will be\n            used - including if `visible` is \"legendonly\" but not\n            if it is `false`. Sets the stacking direction. With \"v\"\n            (\"h\"), the y (x) values of subsequent traces are added.\n            Also affects the default value of `fill`.\n        selected\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.Selected` instance\n            or dict with compatible properties\n        selectedpoints\n            Array containing integer indices of selected points.\n            Has an effect only for traces that support selections.\n            Note that an empty array means an empty selection where\n            the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,\n            any other non-array values means no selection all where\n            the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.\n        showlegend\n            Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this\n            trace is shown in the legend.\n        stackgaps\n            Only relevant when `stackgroup` is used, and only the\n            first `stackgaps` found in the `stackgroup` will be\n            used - including if `visible` is \"legendonly\" but not\n            if it is `false`. Determines how we handle locations at\n            which other traces in this group have data but this one\n            does not. With *infer zero* we insert a zero at these\n            locations. With \"interpolate\" we linearly interpolate\n            between existing values, and extrapolate a constant\n            beyond the existing values.\n        stackgroup\n            Set several scatter traces (on the same subplot) to the\n            same stackgroup in order to add their y values (or\n            their x values if `orientation` is \"h\"). If blank or\n            omitted this trace will not be stacked. Stacking also\n            turns `fill` on by default, using \"tonexty\" (\"tonextx\")\n            if `orientation` is \"h\" (\"v\") and sets the default\n            `mode` to \"lines\" irrespective of point count. You can\n            only stack on a numeric (linear or log) axis. Traces in\n            a `stackgroup` will only fill to (or be filled to)\n            other traces in the same group. With multiple\n            `stackgroup`s or some traces stacked and some not, if\n            fill-linked traces are not already consecutive, the\n            later ones will be pushed down in the drawing order.\n        stream\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.Stream` instance\n            or dict with compatible properties\n        text\n            Sets text elements associated with each (x,y) pair. If\n            a single string, the same string appears over all the\n            data points. If an array of string, the items are\n            mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y) coordinates.\n            If trace `hoverinfo` contains a \"text\" flag and\n            \"hovertext\" is not set, these elements will be seen in\n            the hover labels.\n        textfont\n            Sets the text font.\n        textposition\n            Sets the positions of the `text` elements with respects\n            to the (x,y) coordinates.\n        textpositionsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `textposition`.\n        textsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `text`.\n        texttemplate\n            Template string used for rendering the information text\n            that appear on points. Note that this will override\n            `textinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},\n            for example \"y: %{y}\". Numbers are formatted using\n            d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example\n            \"Price: %{y:$.2f}\".\n            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format\n            for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are\n            formatted using d3-time-format's syntax\n            %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example \"Day:\n            %{2019-01-01|%A}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-\n            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the\n            date formatting syntax. Every attributes that can be\n            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)\n            are available.\n        texttemplatesrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `texttemplate`.\n        uid\n            Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object\n            constancy between traces during animations and\n            transitions.\n        uirevision\n            Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the\n            trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well\n            as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`\n            and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.\n            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are\n            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is\n            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,\n            `selectedpoints` is controlled by\n            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`\n            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is\n            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are\n            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index\n            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove\n            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that\n            the same trace has a different index, you can still\n            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a\n            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.\n        unselected\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.Unselected`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        visible\n            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If\n            \"legendonly\", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as\n            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is\n            visible).\n        x\n            Sets the x coordinates.\n        x0\n            Alternate to `x`. Builds a linear space of x\n            coordinates. Use with `dx` where `x0` is the starting\n            coordinate and `dx` the step.\n        xaxis\n            Sets a reference between this trace's x coordinates and\n            a 2D cartesian x axis. If \"x\" (the default value), the\n            x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If \"x2\", the x\n            coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.\n        xcalendar\n            Sets the calendar system to use with `x` date data.\n        xhoverformat\n            Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `x`  using d3\n            formatting mini-languages which are very similar to\n            those in Python. For numbers, see:\n            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.\n            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-\n            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to\n            d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a\n            decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional\n            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13\n            09:15:23.456* with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would\n            display *09~15~23.46*By default the values are\n            formatted using `xaxis.hoverformat`.\n        xperiod\n            Only relevant when the axis `type` is \"date\". Sets the\n            period positioning in milliseconds or \"M<n>\" on the x\n            axis. Special values in the form of \"M<n>\" could be\n            used to declare the number of months.

With \"interpolate\" we linearly interpolate\n            between existing values, and extrapolate a constant\n            beyond the existing values.\n        stackgroup\n            Set several scatter traces (on the same subplot) to the\n            same stackgroup in order to add their y values (or\n            their x values if `orientation` is \"h\"). If blank or\n            omitted this trace will not be stacked. Stacking also\n            turns `fill` on by default, using \"tonexty\" (\"tonextx\")\n            if `orientation` is \"h\" (\"v\") and sets the default\n            `mode` to \"lines\" irrespective of point count. You can\n            only stack on a numeric (linear or log) axis. Traces in\n            a `stackgroup` will only fill to (or be filled to)\n            other traces in the same group. With multiple\n            `stackgroup`s or some traces stacked and some not, if\n            fill-linked traces are not already consecutive, the\n            later ones will be pushed down in the drawing order.\n        stream\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.Stream` instance\n            or dict with compatible properties\n        text\n            Sets text elements associated with each (x,y) pair. If\n            a single string, the same string appears over all the\n            data points. If an array of string, the items are\n            mapped in order to the this trace's (x,y) coordinates.\n            If trace `hoverinfo` contains a \"text\" flag and\n            \"hovertext\" is not set, these elements will be seen in\n            the hover labels.\n        textfont\n            Sets the text font.\n        textposition\n            Sets the positions of the `text` elements with respects\n            to the (x,y) coordinates.\n        textpositionsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `textposition`.\n        textsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `text`.\n        texttemplate\n            Template string used for rendering the information text\n            that appear on points. Note that this will override\n            `textinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},\n            for example \"y: %{y}\". Numbers are formatted using\n            d3-format's syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example\n            \"Price: %{y:$.2f}\".\n            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format\n            for details on the formatting syntax. Dates are\n            formatted using d3-time-format's syntax\n            %{variable|d3-time-format}, for example \"Day:\n            %{2019-01-01|%A}\". https://github.com/d3/d3-time-\n            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format for details on the\n            date formatting syntax. Every attributes that can be\n            specified per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`)\n            are available.\n        texttemplatesrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `texttemplate`.\n        uid\n            Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object\n            constancy between traces during animations and\n            transitions.\n        uirevision\n            Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the\n            trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well\n            as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`\n            and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.\n            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are\n            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is\n            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,\n            `selectedpoints` is controlled by\n            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`\n            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is\n            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are\n            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index\n            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove\n            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that\n            the same trace has a different index, you can still\n            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a\n            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.\n        unselected\n            :class:`plotly.graph_objects.scatter.Unselected`\n            instance or dict with compatible properties\n        visible\n            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If\n            \"legendonly\", the trace is not drawn, but can appear as\n            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is\n            visible).\n        x\n            Sets the x coordinates.\n        x0\n            Alternate to `x`. Builds a linear space of x\n            coordinates. Use with `dx` where `x0` is the starting\n            coordinate and `dx` the step.\n        xaxis\n            Sets a reference between this trace's x coordinates and\n            a 2D cartesian x axis. If \"x\" (the default value), the\n            x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If \"x2\", the x\n            coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.\n        xcalendar\n            Sets the calendar system to use with `x` date data.\n        xhoverformat\n            Sets the hover text formatting rulefor `x`  using d3\n            formatting mini-languages which are very similar to\n            those in Python. For numbers, see:\n            https://github.com/d3/d3-format/tree/v1.4.5#d3-format.\n            And for dates see: https://github.com/d3/d3-time-\n            format/tree/v2.2.3#locale_format. We add two items to\n            d3's date formatter: \"%h\" for half of the year as a\n            decimal number as well as \"%{n}f\" for fractional\n            seconds with n digits. For example, *2016-10-13\n            09:15:23.456* with tickformat \"%H~%M~%S.%2f\" would\n            display *09~15~23.46*By default the values are\n            formatted using `xaxis.hoverformat`.\n        xperiod\n            Only relevant when the axis `type` is \"date\". Sets the\n            period positioning in milliseconds or \"M<n>\" on the x\n            axis. Special values in the form of \"M<n>\" could be\n            used to declare the number of months. In this case `n`\n            must be a positive integer.\n        xperiod0\n            Only relevant when the axis `type` is \"date\". Sets the\n            base for period positioning in milliseconds or date\n            string on the x0 axis. When `x0period` is round number\n            of weeks, the `x0period0` by default would be on a\n            Sunday i.e. 2000-01-02, otherwise it would be at\n            2000-01-01.\n        xperiodalignment\n            Only relevant when the axis `type` is \"date\". Sets the\n            alignment of data points on the x axis.\n        xsrc\n            Sets the source reference on Chart Studio Cloud for\n            `x`.\n        y\n            Sets the y coordinates.\n        y0\n            Alternate to `y`. Builds a linear space of y\n            coordinates. Use with `dy` where `y0` is the starting\n            coordinate and `dy` the step.\n        yaxis\n            Sets a reference between this trace's y coordinates and\n            a 2D cartesian y axis.
